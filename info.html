              <p>I know what it looks like but this is not a game website.
                  This is a site I made to help everyone at our school.
                  My goal for this site was to make it easier to go to
                  school allowed sites and to have some fun in general.
                  I do not plan on adding any games and I do not want this 
                  site to be a site that students sit on while teachers
                  are trying to teach them very important stuff. The only
                  type of "fun" I would present would be the hall of fame
                  and possibly the announcements for school on the site.  
                  <br>
                  To the teachers, I can take down the site at any time but
                  I am open to suggestions for the site and willing to make 
                  changes to satisfy every staff member or students to make 
                  sure everyone is having a good time. If you have any questions,
                  you can either email me at haltnno@students.pesd.org or just 
                  talk to me during school sometime. Thanks for enjoying the site :)
             </p>
